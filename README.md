# metadataPDF.py
View and change metadata of a PDF with Python

---I recommend modifying the code, adding the file to an input variable or using the `sys` library to use arguments.---

First you must make sure you have the "fitz" library installed
pip --version
pip install PyMuPDF

#Execute
python showmetapdf.py

Then you must open the changemetapdf.py code and add the name of your file to modify
and save it as a new pdf file.

You can see the new metadata of this, using the previous tool.
